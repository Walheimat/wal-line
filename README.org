* wal-line.el

This package is my personal mode line.

** Configuration

The base mode line has no dependencies but by default, all segments
and augmentations are loaded which have dependencies. You can set the
variable =wal-line-features= to customize this.

Even if you use =projectile= you can set =wal-line-project-provider= to
=project= instead.

You can provide your own animation by setting
=wal-line-whale-key-frames=.
